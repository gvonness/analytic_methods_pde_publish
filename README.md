# Analytic Methods in PDE

In this repository are two PDFs representing two versions of a collection of notes I've written on the
subject of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that have been subsequently formed into a textbook.

Please note the these PDFs are in an unrefined state, so please forgive any typos, errata and the like.
I have made these available to handle the occasional requests I still get for them.

These notes have remained dormant for over 10 years, and I can't honestly say when I'll get the time to
go through another iteration of these. However, as my feelings toward the subject haven't changed, I'm
sure I'll get around to this eventually.

If you happen to look at these and find any errata, please create an issue in this repo!

Finally, please note that I am happy for these notes to be used for teaching purposes, if they are found
to be helpful. My belief has always been that this knowledge should be free. To this end, the 2011 version
has a less-restrictive Creative Commons license that should clarify that I'm happy for the notes to be
freely distributed.
